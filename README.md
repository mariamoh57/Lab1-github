# Lab1-github
my first GitHub repository
Hi, my name is Maria. I’m an AI student with a strong interest in technology and intelligent systems. I’m especially interested in Machine Learning because I’m fascinated by how computers can learn from data and make smart decisions. I enjoy exploring how ML can be used to solve real-world problems and improve people’s lives.
